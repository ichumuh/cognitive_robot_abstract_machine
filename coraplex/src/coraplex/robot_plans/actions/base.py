    What it does is its :attr:`action_body`, the node :meth:`create_action_body`
    creates. The action reaches its goal once its body did, and declares itself failed
    as soon as the body failed, so an action can be a step of another one. A body whose
    owner decides its success, such as a single task, is run in an
    :class:`~cramph.composites.Attempt` that decides it.

    .. note:: :class:`~coraplex.plans.designator.DesignatorParameters` is the last
        base, because ORMatic resolves a data access object's parent by walking the
        method resolution order and taking the first mapped class, and an action is
        stored as the statechart node it is.
