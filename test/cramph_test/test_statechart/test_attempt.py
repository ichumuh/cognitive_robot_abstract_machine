"""
Tests for ``Attempt`` (see ``cramph/src/cramph/composites.py``).

The template is exercised by compiling it into a real :class:`Statechart` and ticking
the executor. ``ConstTrueNode`` / ``ConstFalseNode`` stand in for a task that is always
/ never at its goal, and ``CountTicks`` for a failure monitor that fires after a known
number of ticks, so none of these tests needs a world with a robot in it.
