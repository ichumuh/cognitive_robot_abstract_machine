# Future problems

Problems set aside until the statechart refactoring of `plan-cramp-second-iter` is
done. Every test listed here is marked `@pytest.mark.parked` (or `pytestmark =
pytest.mark.parked` for a whole module) and skipped. Once a problem is solved, remove
the marker from its tests and its entry from this file.

## Sending statecharts as JSON

The structure of plans, actions and contexts is still changing (one statechart context
instead of coraplex's own, statecharts without a root node, actions owning their body),
and each of those changes what a statechart's JSON holds. Keeping the round trips green
in the meantime would mean rewriting them for every intermediate shape, so they are
parked until the structure has settled.

Parked whole modules:

- `test/cramph_test/test_statechart/test_json_parsing.py`
- `test/cramph_test/test_statechart/test_extending_from_json.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_motion_statechart/test_json_parsing.py`

Parked tests in otherwise active modules:

- `test/cramph_test/test_statechart/test_statechart.py`: `test_nested_goals`,
  `test_it_survives_a_json_round_trip`,
  `test_a_condition_with_a_predicate_survives_a_json_round_trip`,
  `test_nested_success_condition_survives_json_round_trip`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_motion_statechart/test_collision_avoidance_tasks.py`:
  `test_external_collision_avoidance`,
  `test_external_collision_avoidance_with_weight_above_ca`,
  `test_self_collision_avoidance`, `test_hard_constraints_violated` (they execute the
  statechart that came back from a JSON round trip)
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_motion_statechart/test_composed_goals.py`:
  `test_velocity_limit_has_its_two_limits_after_a_json_round_trip`
- `test/coraplex_test/test_perception.py`:
  `test_perception_task_survives_a_json_round_trip`,
  `test_perception_task_survives_a_chart_round_trip`
- `test/coraplex_test/test_plan/test_plan_statechart.py`:
  `test_an_underspecified_node_is_sent_as_a_node_choosing_its_child`,
  `test_an_expanded_action_is_received_with_the_nodes_it_runs`

Open questions to settle when this is picked up again:

- Whether an underspecified statement (a krrood `Match`) has to survive JSON at all.
  Today `UnderspecifiedNode.statement` is not serialized, and the node is sent as the
  `CompositeNodeChoosingItsChild` it is, so the receiving process asks the sender for
  each child instead of grounding the statement itself. Tests covering that, and a
  statement inside a sent statechart, are still to be written.
- A coraplex `Action` is sent as itself and declares the context extensions it
  requires (`RobotAccess` and, per action, `ExecutionMode` or `MotionToleranceConfig`).
  It reads them only while expanding, which happens in the sending process, but a
  statechart checks them whenever a node joins or compiles, so a receiving process
  whose context lacks them rejects the action with
  `NodesMissingContextExtensionsError`. Either the receiver's context gets them, or
  requirements needed to expand are told apart from those needed to build and tick.
- A giskardpy `MoveGripper` does not survive a JSON round trip: its fail condition
  references nodes outside its scope after deserialization
  (`UnserializableGoalError`/`ConditionScopeError`). This breaks the real-stretch
  cross-process demo, parked as
  `test/experiments_test/real_stretch_demo_test/test_real_stretch_demo_process_boundary.py`:
  `test_demonstration_runs_against_a_controller_in_another_process`.

## ROS 2 goals

Everything that sends a goal to Giskard over ROS 2 sends its statechart as JSON, so it
waits for the problem above.

- `test/giskardpy_test/test_motion_statechart/test_ros.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_abort_exceptions.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_child_choices.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_motion_goal.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_motion_server.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_force_torque_nodes.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_integration_pr2.py`,
  `test_integration_hsr.py`, `test_integration_stretch.py`, `test_integration_daisy.py`
- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_world_updates.py`:
  `test_the_changes_of_a_goal_are_waited_for`,
  `test_changes_that_never_arrive_are_reported`

## Feedback publishing

`giskardpy/middleware/ros2/feedback_publisher.py` reports a running goal's state to the
client, including the nodes waiting for a child. It is parked with the ROS 2 goals.

- `test/giskardpy_test/test_ros2_stuff/test_world_updates.py`:
  `TestRealWorldUpdatesDuringAMotion`, `TestModelChangesOfTheMotionItself`.
  `test_the_robot_is_halted_before_the_motion_is_built_again` expects the control loop
  to halt its command publishers before a recompile. The robot is now decelerated to
  rest by the controller instead (`MotionControl.before_recompile`), so the test has to
  assert that once it is picked up again.
- The feedback assertions of `test_motion_server.py` and `test_child_choices.py`, parked
  with those modules above.

## Design questions set aside

These park no tests; they are design changes the review of ichumuh#8 raised and that
were deliberately left for later.

### A statechart that takes its context from its executor

Building a plan's statechart still reads `Statechart(context=executor.context)`. The
statechart could instead get its context from the executor compiling it, but a node
expands the moment it joins a statechart (`Statechart.add_node`), and expanding reads
the context, so the context would have to be known before the executor is, or
expansion would have to move to compile time. That is a cramph change of its own.

### Underspecified statements as steps of a plan language node

A composite action whose step may be an `a(...)` statement wraps the statement in an
`UnderspecifiedNode` itself (`ActionOfSteps._node_running`). The plan language nodes
could accept a krrood `Match` among their children directly. Two ways to get there:

- cramph defines a node carrying a krrood `Match` (cramph may import krrood), which
  every `CramLanguageNode` wraps a `Match` child in when it adopts it, and coraplex's
  `UnderspecifiedNode` becomes, or extends, that node. The statement then lives in
  cramph although only coraplex grounds it.
- cramph defines a context extension that converts a child a language node cannot run
  into one it can, which coraplex registers for `Match`. Nothing about statements
  enters cramph, but a language node then needs its context to adopt its children,
  which it only has once it joined a statechart.

Separately, the steps of the composite actions are typed as the action they hold
(`pick_up: MoveAndPickUpAction`) although they may hold a `Match`. Typing them
`MoveAndPickUpAction | Match` makes ORMatic leave the field out of the data access
object, so a stored transport loses its steps; ORMatic needs to map such a union first.

### The trial's own sequence around a candidate

`ActionTrial.succeeds` runs a candidate in a `Sequence` of its own, so that the nodes a
plan transformation puts beside it are tried with it, the way the candidate runs for
real inside the `Attempt` of its `UnderspecifiedNode`. Simon would rather not wrap the
candidate; doing without it needs plan transformations that can insert beside a node
no language node runs.

### Holding still inside `Statechart.compile`

Waiting for every `RecompileCallback` to come to rest happens around a world-structure
rebuild and before a node chooses its child (`Statechart._when_held_still`), not inside
`Statechart.compile` itself. A compile that waits has to leave the statechart ticking
with nodes it has not compiled yet, but the state arrays grow the moment a node joins
and the compiled tick keeps reading the arrays it was compiled against, so the tick
would run on stale state until the compile happened.
