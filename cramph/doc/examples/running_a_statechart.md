# Running a Statechart

This example builds the fallback plan from [Statecharts](../statecharts.md#example), runs it
with a `StatechartExecutor` and plots what happened.

## Building the statechart

Every node receives a `StatechartContext`, which holds the world the statechart runs in. The
`StatechartExecutor` compiles the statechart and ticks it until an `EndStatechart` ends it, so
the statechart is built in the context of the executor that runs it. The executor's `pacer`
decides how the ticks are spread over time; the default runs them as fast as possible.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from cramph.composites import Attempt, Sequence, TryInOrder
from cramph.context import StatechartContext
from cramph.executor import StatechartExecutor
from cramph.monitors import CountTicks
from cramph.node import EndStatechart
from cramph.statechart import Statechart
from semantic_digital_twin.world import World

executor = StatechartExecutor(context=StatechartContext(world=World()))
statechart = Statechart(context=executor.context)

slow_approach = Attempt(
    name="slow approach",
    task=CountTicks(name="slow", ticks=100),
    failure_monitors=[CountTicks(name="timeout", ticks=10)],
)
fast_approach = CountTicks(name="fast approach", ticks=5)

plan = Sequence(
    nodes=[
        TryInOrder(nodes=[slow_approach, fast_approach]),
        CountTicks(name="retreat", ticks=5),
    ]
)
statechart.add_node(plan)
statechart.add_node(EndStatechart.when_true(plan))
```

## Ticking it

```{code-cell} ipython3
executor.compile(statechart)
executor.tick_until_end(timeout=100)

print(f"Ticks executed: {executor.tick_count}")
print(f"slow approach: {slow_approach.life_cycle_state.name}")
print(f"failure reasons: {[node.name for node in slow_approach.failure_reasons]}")
print(f"plan: {plan.life_cycle_state.name}")
```

## Plotting

`Statechart.draw` renders the structure of the statechart and its transition conditions with
graphviz. `Statechart.plot_gantt_chart` renders the recorded history, one bar per node,
coloured by its life cycle state in every tick. Pass a context with a `tick_duration` to label
the x-axis in seconds instead of ticks.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from pathlib import Path
from tempfile import mkdtemp

output_directory = Path(mkdtemp())
statechart.draw(str(output_directory / "statechart.pdf"))
statechart.plot_gantt_chart(str(output_directory / "statechart_gantt_chart.pdf"))
```
