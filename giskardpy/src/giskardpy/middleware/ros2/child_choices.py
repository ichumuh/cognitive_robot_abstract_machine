"""
Choosing the child of a node of a running goal on the client.

A node of a goal may choose its child only once it runs, see
:class:`~cramph.composites.CompositeNodeChoosingItsChild`. What it runs is decided by
the client, which holds what the choice is made from, so Giskard publishes the nodes
waiting for a child in its feedback, the client chooses on its copy of the statechart
and sends the nodes the choice added, and Giskard adds them to the running statechart.

.. note:: This is an interim way of getting a client's choices into a running goal,
    meant to be replaced by a proper interface between client and Giskard.
