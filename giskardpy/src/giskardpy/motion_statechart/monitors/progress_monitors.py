    The task counts as approaching its goal while its error lies below the error it had

    threshold for every second since. An error that moves without getting smaller, as
    it does for an arm that collision avoidance keeps pushing back, therefore never

    keep moving within the threshold for as long as it holds the goal, as a grip held
    while something else moves does, and that movement is not progress. Counting it
    would keep a motion whose other tasks are stuck from ever being given up on.
