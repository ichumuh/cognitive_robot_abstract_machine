# Connecting Giskard to a Robot

This tutorial connects Giskard to a robot that is driven by
[ros2_control](https://control.ros.org), using a Universal Robots UR5e as the example.
No real arm is needed: the Universal Robots driver can run on mock hardware, which
integrates the commanded velocities and reports the result as joint states. The setup is
the same one the driver uses for a real arm.

## Prerequisites

- A ROS workspace as described in the
  [monorepo README](../../README.md#optional-setup-your-ros-workspace), sourced in every
  terminal used below.
- The Universal Robots driver: `sudo apt install ros-jazzy-ur-robot-driver`.

## What Giskard needs from a robot

Giskard is configured with four objects:

| Object | What it decides |
|---|---|
| `WorldConfig` | Which robot description is loaded and how the robot is attached to the world. |
| `RobotInterfaceConfig` | Where the state of the robot is read from and where commands are sent. |
| `GiskardServerConfig` | Whether a motion is only simulated (`STANDALONE`) or sent to the robot (`CLOSED_LOOP`). |
| `QPControllerConfig` | The control frequency and the tuning of the controller. |

To command a robot, Giskard needs two things from it:

- a `joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster`, which publishes the joint states;
- a `velocity_controllers/JointGroupVelocityController`, which accepts joint velocities.

Both have to be *active*. Giskard asks the controller manager which controllers are
running and connects to these two kinds on its own, so the joints and topics do not have
to be listed by hand.

## The configuration

```{literalinclude} ../src/giskardpy/middleware/ros2/scripts/tutorial/universal_robot_velocity.py
:language: python
```

- `WorldWithFixedRobot` loads the robot description and fixes the robot to the world. It
  suits an arm that is bolted down. The description is read from the
  `/robot_description` topic, so Giskard uses the same model as the driver.
- `ControllerManagerInterface` asks the controller manager for its active controllers.
  It reads the joint states from the broadcaster and sends velocities to the velocity
  controller.
- `ExecutionMode.CLOSED_LOOP` makes Giskard send its commands to the robot in real time.
- `target_frequency` is the control frequency in hertz.

Because nothing in this file names a joint or a topic, it works unchanged for any
fixed-base robot whose controller manager runs these two controllers.

## Running it

Start the robot on mock hardware, with the velocity controller active:

```bash
ros2 launch ur_robot_driver ur_control.launch.py ur_type:=ur5e robot_ip:=0.0.0.0 \
    use_mock_hardware:=true initial_joint_controller:=forward_velocity_controller
```

Start Giskard in a second terminal. The script is an ordinary Python program:

```bash
`python giskardpy/src/giskardpy/middleware/ros2/scripts/tutorial/universal_robot_velocity.py`
```

Giskard reports the controller it connected to and then waits for goals:

```
Created publisher for /forward_velocity_controller/commands for ['shoulder_pan_joint', ...]
giskard is ready
```

Send a joint goal from a third terminal:

```bash
python giskardpy/src/giskardpy/middleware/ros2/scripts/tutorial/joint_goal_client.py
```

```{literalinclude} ../src/giskardpy/middleware/ros2/scripts/tutorial/joint_goal_client.py
:language: python
```

The arm moves in RViz, and `ros2 topic echo /joint_states` shows the two joints at their
goal positions.

## Starting Giskard from a launch file

Running the script with `python` is enough to get started. To start Giskard together with
the rest of a robot, register the `main` function of the script as a `console_scripts`
entry point of a ROS 2 package and start that executable from a launch file of the
package. The `giskardpy_ros` package in
[cram_ros2_packages](https://github.com/cram2/cram_ros2_packages) does this for the robots
it supports.

## Using a real arm

Start the driver with the address of the arm instead of `use_mock_hardware:=true`. The
Giskard configuration stays the same.

```{warning}
The robot in this tutorial is described only by its URDF. Giskard therefore does not avoid
collisions and limits every joint to a default velocity. Test motions on mock hardware
first.
```
